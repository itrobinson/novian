# Quick Start for GitHub

I am learning GitHub by publishing to GitHub Pages. I'm following [some instructions](https://www.docslikecode.com/) written by Anne Gentle.

# Get the hardware
You need

- a Raspberry Pi
- something that can play audio

The device which plays audio could be an amplifier, headphones or a Bluetooth speaker.

# Install the operating system

Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) on a Secure Digital (SD) card.
